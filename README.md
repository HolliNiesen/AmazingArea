### Problem Statement

From a young age, many people learn to despise mathematics as a whole. They lose sight of the "joy" that 
can be experienced when learning to overcome new challenges.  There are games that exist to combat
exactly this issue, but they tend to lack instruction, and are not intuitive.

My goal is to create a math game that is both intuitive, and exciting to young individuals who might not
have learned to despise the wonderful world of mathematics just yet.
